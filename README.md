CompassionateCare Database Project
Overview
Welcome to the CompassionateCare Database Project. This repository contains the foundational SQL schema and sample data scripts for a database designed to manage the core operations of a compassionate care facility or social services organization. The project focuses on providing a relational database solution to track essential information about clients, care providers, appointments, and treatment plans.

This project is an ideal resource for practicing your skills in data modeling, DDL (Data Definition Language) for building schemas, and DML (Data Manipulation Language) for populating and querying a database that addresses real-world challenges in healthcare or social work data management.

Key Features
This database is designed to support the following functionalities:

Client Management: Store and retrieve detailed information about each client, including personal details and contact information.

Provider Tracking: Maintain a list of care providers, their specializations, and their availability.

Appointment Scheduling: Log and manage appointments, linking clients to providers and specific care plans.

Care Plan Documentation: Track the details of ongoing care plans, documenting goals, progress, and key interventions.

Relationship Mapping: The schema connects clients, providers, and care plans, allowing for comprehensive reporting and analysis of care delivery.

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the database up and running on your local machine.

Choose a SQL Environment: You will need a database management system to run the scripts. PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite are all compatible options.

Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local system:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/CompassionateCare_Database_Project.git

Navigate to the SQL Directory: Open your terminal and change to the sql/ directory within the cloned repository.

Create the Database Schema: Run the schema.sql script to create all the necessary tables and their relationships.

-- For PostgreSQL, from psql:
\i schema.sql

Insert Sample Data: Once the schema is built, execute the data.sql script to populate the tables with realistic sample data.

-- For PostgreSQL, from psql:
\i data.sql

Begin Querying: The database is now ready for you to explore and practice writing your own SQL queries to extract valuable insights.

Explanation of Files
The repository is organized to be intuitive and easy to navigate.

sql/schema.sql: Contains the Data Definition Language (DDL) to create all the database tables, including Clients, Providers, Appointments, and CarePlans, along with their relationships.

sql/data.sql: Contains the Data Manipulation Language (DML) with INSERT statements to populate the tables with sample data, giving you a working dataset from the start.
